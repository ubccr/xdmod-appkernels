---

This guide will outline how to install the Application Kernels package
for Open XDMoD.  Before you install this package, you should already
have both [Open XDMoD](http://open.xdmod.org/install.html) and
[AKRR](akrr.html) installed.

If you installed the Open XDMoD RPM you should install the Open XDMoD
Application Kernels RPM. Likewise, if you installed the Open XDMoD
source package you should install the Open XDMoD Application Kernels
source package.

title: Application Kernels Database Guide
---

The application kernels package requires two additional databases.
These databases are created as part of the [AKRR](akrr.html) installation
process.

### mod_akrr

AKRR database.  Stores data for scheduling application kernel job
submission and raw data returned from application kernel execution.

### mod_appkernel

Application kernels database.  Stores the application kernel data and
ingested data from application kernel execution that is used by the Open
XDMoD portal along with control region data.
